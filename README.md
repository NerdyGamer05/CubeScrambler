## üé≤ Algorithm
The reasoning behind the algorithm is pretty straightforward. For the sake of the explanation, let's say we have an NxN cube. A move is selected randomly from a list of possible moves (`U`,`D`,`L`,`R`,`F`,`B`). The random move is then added to the scramble unless **(1)** the random move is same as the last move in the sequence (e.g. `F` is the "same" as `F2`, `F'`, or any other variation that includes `F`) or **(2)** the random move has not been _simplified_ (see below). If the move is deemed valid, a valid ending may be concatenated by random selection (`'` or `2` for **2x2** & **3x3** and `'`, `2`,`w`,`w'`, or `w2` for **4x4**-**7x7**). Additionally, a prefix may concatenated for **6x6** and **7x7** cubes to express triple layer turns (only if the triple layer turn is randomly selected). Once the scramble length hits the predetermined length, the scrambler cuts off and the scramble sequence is returned.

## ü§ì Simplification
Let's start with an example. The sequence `L2 R L'` is the same as `L R`. This is because NxN cube movements all have opposites, which are essentially (_parallel_) movements that don't interfere with each other (`U`‚áî`D`, `L`‚áî`R`, & `F`‚áî`B` for NxN cubes). However, simplification doesn't always apply. For example, the pyraminx **cannot** use simplification since each layer is affected by the movement of the other layers. Here's a quick "definition": **a move has been _simplified_ if the sequence is constructed in a way such that a move cannot be removed to reduce a sequence**. To make sense of that statement, let's discuss the design. A [`Set`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set) is used to store these unsimplified moves. If the first condition is met & the `Set` doesn't contain the randomly generated move, then the random move is added to the sequence. After the random move is added, the `Set` is filtered so that every move except the most recently added movement and its opposite are removed. For example, if the most recent move was `F2`, then every movement in the `Set` except `F` and `B` (opposite) is removed. The opposite movement is ignored since it is not impacted by the random move (their layers are parallel). This process is performed **every time** a new movement is added to the scrambling sequence to prevent _simplification_, by building a scrambling sequence while prohibiting subsequences that can be reduced, which inevitably builds stronger scrambling sequences (hopefully some of that makes sense).
